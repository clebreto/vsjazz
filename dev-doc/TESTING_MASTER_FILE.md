# Testing Master File Feature

## Setup Complete

The extension has been modified to support master file functionality:

### Changes Made

1. **package.json**:
   - Added `jasmin.masterFile` configuration setting
   - Added `jasmin.setMasterFile` command

2. **extension.ts**:
   - Status bar item showing current master file (visible on .jazz/.jinc files)
   - Command to select master file via file picker
   - Automatic sending of `jasmin/setMasterFile` notification to LSP server
   - Configuration change listener

### Test Workspace Created

Location: `/Users/clebreto/dev/splits/vsjazz-test-workspace`

Files:
- `main.jazz` - Master file that requires lib files
- `lib/utils.jinc` - Utility functions (add_one, multiply_two)
- `lib/crypto.jinc` - Crypto function (hash)

Settings (`.vscode/settings.json`):
```json
{
  "jasmin.path": "/Users/clebreto/dev/splits/jasmin-lsp/_build/default/jasmin-lsp/jasmin_lsp.exe",
  "jasmin.masterFile": "main.jazz"
}
```

## How to Test

### Step 1: Open Extension Development

```bash
cd /Users/clebreto/dev/splits/vsjazz
code .
```

Press `F5` to launch the extension in a new VSCode window.

### Step 2: Open Test Workspace

In the Extension Development Host window:
- File ‚Üí Open Folder
- Select `/Users/clebreto/dev/splits/vsjazz-test-workspace`

### Step 3: Verify Status Bar

When you open any `.jazz` or `.jinc` file, you should see in the status bar (bottom right):

- `üìÑ Master: main.jazz` - if master file is set
- `‚ö†Ô∏è No Master File` - if no master file is set

**Click on the status bar item** to change the master file.

### Step 4: Test Master File Selection

1. Click on the status bar item OR
2. Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`)
3. Type "Jasmin: Set Master File"
4. Select a `.jazz` file from the picker

You should see:
- Confirmation message: "Master file set to: main.jazz"
- Status bar updated
- Setting saved to workspace configuration

### Step 5: Test Symbol Resolution

1. Open `lib/utils.jinc`
2. Right-click on `add_one` function
3. Select "Find All References"
4. Should find usage in `main.jazz` (because main.jazz is the master file)

### Step 6: Verify LSP Server Logs

Check the LSP server logs to confirm the notification was received:

```bash
# In another terminal
tail -f ~/.vscode/extensions/*/logs/lsp.log
```

Look for:
```
[LOG] : Received jasmin/setMasterFile notification
[LOG] : Setting master file to: file:///.../main.jazz
[LOG] : Master file set to: file:///.../main.jazz
[LOG] : Using master file for dependency resolution: file:///.../main.jazz
```

### Step 7: Test Configuration Persistence

1. Close VSCode
2. Reopen the test workspace
3. Master file should be restored from settings
4. Status bar should show the correct master file

### Step 8: Test Without Master File

1. Open workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`)
2. Remove the `jasmin.masterFile` line
3. Save
4. Status bar should show "‚ö†Ô∏è No Master File"
5. Set master file again via command/status bar
6. Verify it gets saved to settings

## Expected Behavior

### Status Bar States

| Condition | Display | Clickable |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| .jazz/.jinc file open + master set | `üìÑ Master: filename.jazz` | Yes |
| .jazz/.jinc file open + no master | `‚ö†Ô∏è No Master File` | Yes |
| Other file open | Hidden | - |

### Configuration

The setting should support:
- Relative paths: `"main.jazz"`
- Workspace variable: `"${workspaceFolder}/src/main.jazz"`
- Absolute paths: `"/full/path/to/main.jazz"`

### LSP Integration

When master file is set or changed:
1. Extension sends `jasmin/setMasterFile` notification
2. LSP server receives and logs it
3. Symbol resolution uses master file as entry point
4. Only files reachable from master file are searched

## Troubleshooting

### Status Bar Not Showing

- Check file has `.jazz` or `.jinc` extension
- Check languageId is set to "jasmin" in bottom right
- Reload window if needed

### Master File Not Set

- Check settings file syntax
- Check path is correct (relative to workspace root)
- Try using command to set it explicitly

### LSP Server Not Receiving Notification

- Check LSP server path is correct in settings
- Check LSP server is running (look for process)
- Enable LSP client logging: `"jasmin.trace.server": "verbose"`

### Compilation Issues

If you need to recompile after changes:
```bash
cd /Users/clebreto/dev/splits/vsjazz
pixi run npm run compile
```

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Status bar shows master file when .jazz/.jinc files are open
‚úÖ Clicking status bar opens file picker
‚úÖ Selected file is saved to workspace settings
‚úÖ LSP server receives notification
‚úÖ Configuration persists across restarts
‚úÖ Relative paths are resolved correctly
‚úÖ Symbol resolution uses master file

## Files Modified

- `package.json` - Added configuration and command
- `src/extension.ts` - Implemented all functionality
- Backup files created:
  - `package.json.backup`
  - `src/extension.ts.backup`
